				<h5>Recent Work &#8605;</h5>

					<p> This month, I worked with a major steel production company to help identify key areas that can be improved in their existing process as they begin a journey of digital transformation. Later this month, I'll be working with IBM+AIGA to provide facilitation training.</p>

					<p> <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/73252002/fate-foretold-the-tarot-card-game">Fate Foretold</a> is a tarot-inspired strategy card game where players race against one another to take control of Fate itself.  Initially concepted in 2014, we raised over $18,000 for final production and distribution of the game into the hands of players world wide via Kickstarter. Our world-wide release was March  </p>

					<p> <a href="http://www.thisisartmeat.com/">artMEAT</a> is prepping to release Volume 1.2 of artGLOSS: OTHER at our next event in late April/Early May. We've got an excellent event planned that brings together the best actors, sound editors, foley artists, musicians in town for a fully immersive audio-visual experience. 
					You can see old issues  <a href="http://www.thisisartmeat.com/zine/">here.</a></p>
