<b>Hey there!</b>
I’m an artist-turned designer currently based in Austin, Texas.
</font>

Currently, I am:

» a UX Lead at <a href="http://www.ibm.com/design/">IBM Design,</a> trying to make the world a better place for knowledge workers in the legal profession, and spend quite a bit of time educating the business on design thinking methodologies

» Moonlighting as the Executive Curator of <a href="http://www.thisisartmeat.com/">artMEAT,</a> an initiative to strengthen the foundation of communities by fostering the collaboration of siloed individual artists, art enthusiasts, the creatively inclined, persons unexposed to the arts, and those with the slightest investment in creative exploits.

» Remembering what it is to simply play in my spare time 

A lot of the work I've been doing on lately is confidential. But if you wana chat, feel free to contact me. I’d love to show you my stuff & daydream on what magic we can make together.
