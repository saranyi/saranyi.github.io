					<b> <a href="./TSP.html"> The Student Publication Volume 36 | Form + Fiction</a></b>
					<br>
					Form + Fiction looks to engage a discussion on the role of design and designers in shaping, framing, and reflecting reality. While the notion of the designer as a constructor or visionary of a future reality is not a new one, the increasing complexity and connectivity of our world begs for renewed vigor in its evaluation.
