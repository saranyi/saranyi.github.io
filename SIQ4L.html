				<h5>Background/Overview:</h5>

				<p> The IBM Information Lifecycle Governance portfolio helps clients manage the lifecycle of unstructured business information and data. As part of IBM Design Thinking's Hallmark Project program, ILG has initiated a design-first strategy to consolidate all offerings within the portfolio. </p>

				<p>The design team was brought in mid-2014 to help facilitate the strategy of these offerings and produce new, user-friendly product offerings. The first of these is Stored IQ for Legal, a comprehensive offering for IBM's previous eDiscovery and Early Case Assessment products. </p>

				<p>StoredIQ for Legal allows legal teams to find and analyze unstructured information in place to gain faster insight into data and help ensure only the right information is collected.  Approximately 90 percent of corporate cases are settled prior to the collection process. In many organizations where no insight into data associated with a case is available, a settlement is made with little to no information regarding the actual merits of the case. StoredIQ for Legal is designed to accelerate the eDiscovery process and provide legal teams with insight into relevant data in-place prior to collection. Legal teams can save time and gain flexibility by not having to move data before analysis. They can take action on data before collection, acquiring insights from data in a matter of hours versus weeks and using that knowledge to make more informed business decisions. </p>

				<p>
					<b> Project Landscape: </b>
					<ul>
						<li>+ Market opportunity for end-to-end eDiscovery solution means we could deliver a unique product to the market </li>
						<li>+ Highly technological products give us the “bang,” but the UIs are incredibly hard to use for non-technical users</li> 
						<li>+ Unhappy customers put extra pressure and a time constraint on product team</li>
						<li>+ Ability for a fresh start using design thinking to facilitate product development  </li>
					</ul>

				</p>

				<p>Challenge 1: Build a simplified, consolidated product that pulls on features of 3+ existing IBM products.</p>
